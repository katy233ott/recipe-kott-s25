    <h1>Swole Balls of Glory</h1>
    <p>The BEST Preworkout Power Poppers</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 scoop protien powder (any flavor-excpet sadness)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon peanut butt (or almond butter if you're bougie)</li>
      <li>1 banana (overripe, like your gym socks)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup oats (because you're civilized)</li>
      <li>A dash of cinnamon (for flair and fake fitness influencer vibes)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Throw the banana into a bowl. Smash it like your deadlift PR. Pretend it's someone who told you "cardio is better than lifting"...gross.</li>
      <li>Add the peanut butter and mix until it's smooth enough to make you question why this isn't dessert.</li>
      <li>Toss in the oats and protien powder. Stir until it looks like something your caveman ancestors would hoard.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle cinnamon like you're a wizard casting spells of gains. Optional: whisper "swole" after every shake.</li>
      <li>Roll into bite-sized, refrigerate for 15 mins (or eat immediately if you lack self-control and self-respect). Consume before your workout and feel your muscles whisper, "thank you".</li>
    </ol>
